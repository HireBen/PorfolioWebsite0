<h1>Meet the Code Wizard 🧙‍♂️</h1>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Ben (aka <strong>Webby McWebface</strong>), your friendly neighborhood web developer. 🌐✨</p>
        <p>Who Am I?</p>
        <p>I'm the guy who turns coffee into code, pixels into websites, and bugs into features. My keyboard is my wand, and my browser tabs are my spellbook. Whether it's crafting elegant CSS or wrestling with JavaScript dragons, I'm always up for an adventure.</p>
        <p>My Superpowers</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML Sorcery: I speak fluent HTML, transforming plain text into beautifully structured web pages. My tags are like incantations—&lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, and &lt;img&gt;—they weave the fabric of the internet.</li>
            <li>CSS Enchantment: With a flick of my stylus, I make designs dance. Flexbox? Grid? I wield them all. And gradients? Oh, they're my favorite potions. 🌈</li>
            <li>JavaScript Wizardry: I tango with event listeners, summon APIs, and conjure animations. My spells include addEventListener(), fetch(), and setTimeout(). But beware the cursed null and undefined!</li>
            <li>Responsive Alchemy: My layouts adapt like chameleons. From desktop castles to mobile huts, I ensure your site looks enchanting on every screen size.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fun Facts</p>
        <ul>
            <li>🎩 I once turned a coffee stain into a CSS gradient. True story!</li>
            <li>📸 My camera roll? Full of screenshots from inspiring websites.</li>
            <li>🎮 When I'm not coding, I'm battling pixelated dragons in retro games.</li>
        </ul>
